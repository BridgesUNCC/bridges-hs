* *_data/bridges-links.yaml*: Links to BRIDGES Classes, used in the "Documentation" section on project pages.

* *_layouts/default.html*: The top-level layout used by all pages. Includes navigation bar, title bar, and copyright notice.

* *_layouts/assignment-page.html*: This layout extends the default layout and is used by project pages. The "jekyll-datapage-generator" plugin automatically generates these pages using the information in _data/assignments.yaml.

(The source for this site is in the master branch; the generated HTML is in the gh_pages branch.) Copied from [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-deploy-action).

* *assets/images/*: Images for this site, including example output images for each project.

* *assets/main.css*: A CSS file which controls the styling of all pages.
