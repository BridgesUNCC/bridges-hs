                Welcome to the high school section of the NSF Bridges project at UNCC! This website is intended to help
                high school teachers implement Bridges assignments in their classrooms. This article provides a concise
                overview and explanation of the website.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have not already set up Bridges with your IDE of choice, a tutorial is available
                <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_setup.html">here</a>.
            </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Note: The high school section of Bridges only uses the Java programming language.
                </p>

            <h2 id="courses">Courses</h2>

            <p>
                This website provides instructional materials for the computer sciences courses AP CS A and Advanced
                Topics.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AP CS A</strong>: This course consists of assignments corresponding to the AP CS A
                    curriculum as outlined in the <a
                        href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a">AP
                        Computer Science A Course Description.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Topics</strong>: This course consists of assignments corresponding to curriculum
                    beyond AP CS A. Many of
                    these topics are also present in first or second year college computer science courses.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                When viewing either course, every assignment is tagged with the topic(s) it covers. In addition, a more
                detailed list of topics can be found within each assignment page.</p>

            <h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>

            <p>
                Project-based learning is the foundation of Bridges. Each assignment is designed to teach computer
                science concepts. An assignment page has the following structure:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Description</li>
                <li>(Optional) Details / concept explanation</li>
                <li>Topics</li>
                <li>Intended learning outcomes</li>
                <li>Instructional materials</li>
                <li>(Optional) Additional information</li>
                <li>Documentation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This provides a basic overview of the project. Think of the description as a “pitch” for you to use the
                assignment.
            </p>

            <h3>(Optional) Details / concept explanation</h3>
            <p>
                Some assignments require further information or explanation about a specific topic. This section is
                optional, and most assignments do not include it.
            </p>

            <h3>Topics</h3>
            <p>
                This is a list of all the topics covered in the assignment. The tags found in the assignment list are
                not
                exhaustive, but the topics list is.
            </p>

            <h3>Intended learning outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                Each assignment has been designed with specific ILOs in mind. It is important to note that the ILOs are
                written with the assumption that all instructional materials (see below) are used. So, if you adapt the
                assignment, the ILOs may change.
            </p>

            <h3>Instructional materials</h3>
            <p>
                This is the most important part of the assignment page. The instructional materials consist of three
                sections: student, teacher, and resources.
            </p>

            <h4>Student</h4>
            <p>
                Each assignment includes a student worksheet which consists of instructions, information, and questions
                for students as they program. The worksheets enable students to work at their own pace, and the
                questions help
                you assess student understanding of concepts. Of course, you can adapt these worksheets to meet the
                needs ofyour classroom.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, some assignments include test cases or example outputs to help students check their work.
            </p>

            <h4>Teacher</h4>
            <p>
                Each assignment includes answers keys for the student worksheet. Some of the more challenging assignments
                also have a teacher walkthrough explaining the code and worksheet. Finally, most assignments include a
                rubric which you can change if you wish.
            </p>    
            <h4>Resources</h4>
            <p>
                The resource section can vary significantly depending on the project, but it will always include solution
                files and scaffold files. The scaffold is what you provide to students, and the solution is the finished
                product. Scaffolds usually include directions or assistance that correspond to the student worksheet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, the resources section sometimes includes data files, additional tutorials, and links embedded
                in the student worksheet.
            </p>

            <h3>(Optional) Additional Information</h3>
            <p>This section includes information such as the source of the project if it is adapted from another resource.</p>

            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                The documentation section provides links to all the relevant classes of the assignment. It is typically
                expected that reading documentation is necessary to complete the assignment.
